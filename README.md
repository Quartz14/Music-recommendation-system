# Music-recommendation-system

Built a music recommendation system, that recommends songs by grouping similar users and using that knowledge to find shared intrests. It then fetches and plays the recommended song from youtube automatically.
It also considers the case for new users, by asking them to rate few randomly selected songs, and use that as the initial data for the recommendation system.
